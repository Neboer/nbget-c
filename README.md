# nbget
nbget is yet another multi-thread file downloader with a full name "Neboer's wget".

But however, it supports proxy for a single thread. That means you can specify many proxies at a time to download a file. nbget will automatically arrange the size of each block
to adapt different thread's speed. As a result, the download speed will be very fast.

This is quite interesting and is useful too. nbget based on libcurl 
so it supports a wide range of protocols, is stable and cross-platform as well.

nbget is licenced under MIT. Looking forward to your contribution.
